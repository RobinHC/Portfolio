<h2 id="st-seminar-of-isp-ras-web-laboratory-for-mechanics-of-a-continuous-medium">1st seminar of ISP RAS web-laboratory for Mechanics of a continuous medium</h2>
<p>Place: ISP RAS, 17:00, room 110</p>
<p>&quot;Application of discontinuous Galerkin method for solving gas dynamics equations: ideas, approaches, challenges&quot;</p>
<p>Presenters:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Lukin V.V. (Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics RAS)</li>
<li>Marchevsky I. K. (Bauman Moscow State University)</li>
</ol>
<p>Approaches for construction of numerical solution of inviscid perfect gas dynamics equations using discontinuous Galerking method are considered. Questions of selection of basis functions, non-monotonicity indicators and limiters are studied for the case of one dimensional flow. Different WENO limiters with generalization are considered for moments of order greater than zero. Results of simulation for well-known cases are presented. Ways of enhancement for three-dimensional case are discussed.</p>
