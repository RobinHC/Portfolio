<h1 id="libacoustics">libAcoustics</h1>
<p>The toolbox for numerical analysis of acoustic noise</p>
<p>The library is intended for the calculation of acoustic pressure and sound pressure level generated by turbulent flow of gas or fluid in far and near field by means of different acoustic analogies or by solving wave equations numerically with boundary element method. Next methods and analogies are implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Curle analogy;</p></li>
<li><p>Ffowcs Williams-Hawking analogy;</p></li>
<li><p>Boundary Element Method using OpenFOAM and BEMPP software.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The library is dynamically linked to OpenFOAM solvers via functionObject technology. Parallel execution implemented with MPI technology.</p>
