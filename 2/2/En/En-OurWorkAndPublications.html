<td align="left">A large number of available computational fluid dynamics codes include tools for analysis of computational aeroacoustics problems. Such tools are proprietary as well as the codes themselves. Actually, the level of development of such codes as OpenFOAM makes it possible to implement enough opportunities for complication of physical models and increasing the scale of the issues described. In our paper, we develop a dynamic library libAcoustics which may be compiled independently of any modules of the main OpenFOAM package and the type of solvers being used in the model. The implemented Curle’s analogy in library makes it possible to obtain acoustic spectra under the conditions of turbulent flows around arbitrary solids in a medium moving at a low velocity of flow. Calculation of the acoustic field was made for 3D test case of Cylinder – NACA 0012 Wing Profile configuration. The analogy allows user to define solvers settings through standard user I/O dictionaries of the OpenFOAM. A complete implementation of the analogy is capable of producing parallel computation. The libAcoustics library is free and is available for download on demand.</td>

<td align="left">In this work a hybrid scheme based on the PISO-algorithm and Kurganov-Tadmor's numerical scheme is proposed. This scheme utilizes compressible PISO method for coupling between velocity and pressure and Kurganov-Tadmor scheme for formulation of non-oscillating convective fluxes. Compressible and incompressible regimes of developed model are switched with blending function depending on local Mach and CFL number. A numerical scheme is implemented by means of OpenFOAM ver. 2.3.0 as pisoCentralFoam independent solver. Investigation of the mathematical model was conducted and exemplified by test cases. Proposed scheme can be used for wide range of Mach numbers from 0.01 to 3 or higher The mesh convergence was analyzed. Comparison of the results with the experimental and analytic data was carried out. The solver was tested in a parallel mode on a computer cluster.</td>
