<td align="left">A large number of available computational fluid dynamics codes include tools for analysis of computational aeroacoustics problems. Such tools are proprietary as well as the codes themselves. Actually, the level of development of such codes as OpenFOAM makes it possible to implement enough opportunities for complication of physical models and increasing the scale of the issues described. In our paper, we develop a dynamic library libAcoustics which may be compiled independently of any modules of the main OpenFOAM package and the type of solvers being used in the model. The implemented Curle’s analogy in library makes it possible to obtain acoustic spectra under the conditions of turbulent flows around arbitrary solids in a medium moving at a low velocity of flow. Calculation of the acoustic field was made for 3D test case of Cylinder – NACA 0012 Wing Profile configuration. The analogy allows user to define solvers settings through standard user I/O dictionaries of the OpenFOAM. A complete implementation of the analogy is capable of producing parallel computation. The libAcoustics library is free and is available for download on demand.</td>

<td align="left">In this work a hybrid scheme based on the PISO-algorithm and Kurganov-Tadmor's numerical scheme is proposed. This scheme utilizes compressible PISO method for coupling between velocity and pressure and Kurganov-Tadmor scheme for formulation of non-oscillating convective fluxes. Compressible and incompressible regimes of developed model are switched with blending function depending on local Mach and CFL number. A numerical scheme is implemented by means of OpenFOAM ver. 2.3.0 as pisoCentralFoam independent solver. Investigation of the mathematical model was conducted and exemplified by test cases. Proposed scheme can be used for wide range of Mach numbers from 0.01 to 3 or higher The mesh convergence was analyzed. Comparison of the results with the experimental and analytic data was carried out. The solver was tested in a parallel mode on a computer cluster.</td>

<td align="left">The hybrid method for approximation of advective terms is proposed in order to resolve flows in the wide Mach numbers region. This hybrid method is based on the Kurganov- Tadmor (KT) scheme and projection method PISO (Pressure Implicit with Splitting Operators). In order to study hybrid method properties a set of cases with analytical solution or experimental data for different classes of flows was considered: a) compressible flows - propagation of the wave in straight channel (Sod's Problem), supersonic flow over flat wedge, supersonic flow over backward step, flow over forward step with supersonic velocities, flow in supersonic converging-diverging nozzle with shock wave; b) incompressible flows - subsonic flow of laminar viscous fluid in the channel with circle cross section, flow around cylinder in laminar and turbulent regimes, mixing of two gases in 2D flat channel; c) industrial and academic verification tests - superisonic flow of air in NASA nozzle for pressure ratio 5, expansion of stationary equilibrium hot plasma in vacuum; d) qualitative assessment of the hybrid method adequacy for industrial cases - numerical simulation of flows in high speed micro- compressor, simulation of two-phase flow in liquid ring pump. All materials are available for public access through GitHub project <a href="https://github.com/unicfdlab">github.com/unicfdlab</a></td>

<td align="left">Direct numerical simulation of internal gravity waves focusing and developement of a wave attractor was performed with the help of two different numerical approaches. Mathematical formulation corresponds to experiments on exitations of inner waves in a trapezoidal container with salt solutions through forced oscillations of the left boundary. It was shown that numerical simulations reproduce the experiments after taking into account ther imperfection of linear salinity profile near the upper boundary. The amplitudes of resulting oscillations in both numerical simulations are increased as compared to the experiments due to loss of energy of the 3D wave generator in the experiments. Despite the fact that the general shape of the attractor is reproduced by both method, there are differences in velocity profiles near the left boundary. This fact requires further investigations since this discrepancy may in influence nonlinear dynamics of developing instabilities.</td>

<td align="left">The MCF software package devoted to solving coupled problems of hydroelasticity is described. Various ways of solving the problems with strong and weak coupling are considered. Iterative methods are chosen due to their simplicity in implementation and scaling. The coupling of the OpenFOAM software package (turbulent motion of incompressible, weakly compressible, and compressible fluids) with the two models of structural dynamics based on the finite-volume method (OpenFOAM) and on the modal approach (UZOR) is discussed. The performance analysis of the developed software using the clusters of the Taganrog Institute of Technology and the State University of Chelyabinsk is given.</td>

<td align="left">Testing of capabilities of open-source BEM++ code for simulation of acoustics problems at medium and high frequencies is presented. The BEM++ library is a universal tool, which allows to build discrete models for boundary integral operators (single-, double- and adjoint double-layer potential operators and hypersingular boundary operators) and solve boundary element method problems for Helmholtz, Laplace and Maxwell equations using Python libraries. Solution for the test problem of scattering plane wave on spherical obstacle with using BEM++ demonstrates good convergence with the results of analytical solutions. The relative errors satisfy to acceptable values 5% in solving engineering tasks, this fact allows to use this library as an alternative to commercial software. Capability of BEM++ library to calculate acoustic fields for frequencies from 5 Hz to 5 kHz enables move to solving more difficult engineering challenges of the aerospace industry. The main restriction for this is a time of computation, because only shared-memory technology of the code parallelization is implemented. However, open architecture of the library allows to remove this disadvantage. Meshes for BEM++ can have big size and be based on E geometric model with complex geometrical objects. Also, it should be noted, that for implementation to engineering practice it is desirable to integrate the library with existing interactive systems of pre- and post-processing, for example, with Salome.</td>

<td align="left">The aim of the present research is to develop software for the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM) and its verification on the model problem of viscous incompressible flow simulation in a square cavity. The Lagrangian description of the medium motion is used: the nodes of the finite element mesh move together with the fluid that allows to consider them as particles of the medium. Mesh cells deform when in time-stepping procedure, so it is necessary to reconstruct the mesh to provide stability of the finite element numerical procedure. Meshing algorithm allows us to obtain the mesh, which satisfies the Delaunay criteria: it is called possible triangles method&quot;. This algorithm is based on the well-known Fortune method of Voronoi diagram constructing for a certain set of points in the plane. The graphical representation of the possible triangles method is shown. It is suitable to use generalization of Delaunay triangulation in order to construct meshes with polygonal cells in case of multiple nodes close to be lying on the same circle.</td>
